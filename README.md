# 🧬 Stable Diffusion Cross-Attention Fine-Tuning  
### Lightweight CIFAR-10 Adaptation + CLIP Evaluation

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the implementation for Stable Diffusion finetuning using **cross-attention–only training** under a single 16GB GPU.  
We evaluate text-image alignment using CLIPScore, compare baseline vs. finetuned generations, and include both quantitative tables & visual grids.

📄 NeurIPS-style Final Report Included  
📊 CLIP score benchmarking automated  
🖼 Visual results reproducible end-to-end
